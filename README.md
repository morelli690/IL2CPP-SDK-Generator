# IL2CPP-SDK-Generator
A free, public and open sourced IL2CPP SDK Generator. This is not completely finished and is a work in progress prototype, I will fix bugs as I go.

# How to use
Step 1: Download the latest release from releases
Step 2: Dump the dlls of your desired il2cpp unity game by using this: https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper
Step 3: Copy all the dlls inside of the DummyDll output directory into the Input folder in the release you downloaded.
Step 4: Run the executable file and watch your sdk be generated. :^)
